ReDuX distribution:
===================
 This C based ReDuX distribution consists of 2 directories:
     caldes3.7: the ALDES-C compiler (Version 3.7)
     redux1.6:  the ReDuX System (Version 1.6)

 To install ReDuX first install the ALDES-compiler (see caldes3.7/README) 
 and then follow the installation directives for the ReDuX system
 (see redux1.6/rinstall.dvi or redux1.6/README). 

 General information:
 The ALDES-C compiler produces a lot of warnings.  
 Warnings No. 2 and 12 are harmless and need not alert you.
 During the installation also some warnings no. 4 and no. 5 may occur. 
 These warnings are harmless too.

 The installation scripts have been tested on Sun4/10/Ultra (SunOS 4.1.3,
 Solaris 2.5) and on PCs under Linux 2.x.
 ReDuX has also been successfully installed on a IBM RS6000 (AIX),
 on Sun3s, and on Solbourns (OS/MP) and on PCs under Linux. 
 The ALDES compiler has also been installed (by hand) on DOS-machines.

Getting ReDuX via ftp
=====================
On the ftp-server of the Wilhelm-Schickard-Institut
(ftp.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de) ReDuX is stored in the directory
"/pub/SR/ReDuX" which contains the files
    README
    caldes37.tgz
    redux16.tgz

After transferring these files to your machine, caldes37.tgz and redux16.tgz
must first be decompressed using the gnu-tools gunzip or zcat and then
unpack the tar-files caldes37.tar and redux16.tar:
 % gunzip caldes37.tgz
 % gunzip redux16.tgz
 % cd  /usr/local              # go to installation directory,
                               # /usr/local is the preferred one.
                               # Assume caldes37.tar redux16.tar are 
                               # in /tmp-install.
 % tar xvf /tmp-install/caldes37.tar
 % tar xvf /tmp-install/redux16.tar
Now follow the installation guide lines in /usr/local/caldes3.7/README and
/usr/local/redux1.6/rinstall.dvi or /usr/local/redux1.6/README.

Note, even though /usr/local is the preferred installation directory, there
is no problem installing ALDES and ReDuX at other places. You may however
have to change some path names as indicated in the respective README files.
There is also no problem to rename the ReDuX and ALDES directories
it you update the path names as indicated in the README files.
