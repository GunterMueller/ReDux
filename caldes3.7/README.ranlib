Some Operating systems like SOLARIS 2, do not know the ranlib command.
To take this into account any ranlib comand in a make file must be
preceded by a `-'sign. This is controled by the SOLARIS variable in  the
Makefile.

In shell scripts (like ald) an error message ``Commamd not found'' will be
output but the script will continue. If you don't like the error message
uncomment the ranlib command, it is not needed.
