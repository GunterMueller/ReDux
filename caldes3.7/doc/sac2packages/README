Documentation of SAC-2 packages
===============================

The documentation gathered in this directory is neither complete 
nor up-to-date. Seemingly it has been derived from the original
SAC-2 documentation and therefore all credits should go to
George E. Collins and Ruediger G. K. Loos.

Let me say a few words to the main differences between the current
ALDES(V3.7)/SAC-2 version and the one described in this directory.
Most of the changes concern the backend language and the I/O 
interface provided by the basic system. Yet the description of most
(in particular the algebraic) data types have been left unchanged.
This is why I consider this documentation still valuable and included
it in this distribution.

Some striking differences between the current ALDES(V3.7)/SAC-2 
version and the one described in this directory:

* ALDES is translated to C by the current compiler.
  Therefore FORTRAN-operations and data types should be mapped to
  C-operations and data types (see also  R. Buendgen & J. Walter: 
  "A C-backend for the ALDES Compiler").

* ALDES does not use the character card any more. It uses ASCII-code
  instead. Therefore global arrays ACODE, LCODE and SCODE do not exist
  any more.

* The Fortran functions INPUT and OUTPUT have been replaced by according
  ALDES functions that call a C-function IO which is provided with the
  system. Also a standard CLOCK function that should work on all UNIX systems
  will be built-up by the Makefile.

* There are no test programs provided with this distribution (unless you 
  consider ReDuX as a major test program).

* File-I/O has been extended allowing to open and close files whose
  names are given by an ALDES-string (bs:CLOSE; lp:FOPENR, FOPENW).

* Command line arguments and environment variables can be accessed by
  ALDES(V3.7)/SAC-2  (bs: ARGNO; lp: ARGET, ENVGET, OPTGET).
