A description of the ALDES language can be found in
[LC91] R. Loos & G. Collins:
    "Revised Report on the Algorithm Description Language ALDES"
     Wilhelm-Schickard-Institut fuer Informatik,
     D-7076 Tuebingen, Germany, WSI-Report 92-14, 1992

An older version of ALDES is  described in
[Loo81] R. Loos:
     "The Algorithm Description Language ALDES (Report)"
     ACM SIGSAM Bull. 10 (1), pp 15-39, 1976

A further Publication on ALDES that discusses some conventions is
[Loo91] R. Loos:
     "Publication ALDES"
      Wilhelm-Schickard-Institut fuer Informatik,
      D-7076 Tuebingen, Germany, WSI-Report 91-4, 1991

A description of the ALDES C-backend
[BW93]  R. Buendgen & J. Walter: 
     "A C-backend for the ALDES Compiler"
      Wilhelm-Schickard-Institut fuer Informatik,
      D-7076 Tuebingen, Germany, WSI-Report 93-3, 1993

      This is the only piece of documentation concerning ALDES, I have the 
      sources of. Besides describing the backend (ALDES is first translated to 
      Elementary ALDES which is in turn translated to C) it contains some 
      valuable information on parameter passing and a list of global system 
      variables.
   

ALDES pitfalls
==============
1)  The ALDES compiler reads only the 72 first columns of each line.
    The rest of the line is skipped.
2)  All global variables declared by a programmer that occur in a program
    must be locally declared in the main program.
3)  Each main program must begin with some variant of an initialization
    procedure BEGINi or a procedure that calls a BEGINi almost immediately.
