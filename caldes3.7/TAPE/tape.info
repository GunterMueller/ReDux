FORTRAN primitives
14.	fp	   	fortran primitives

Note added to new version ALDES-2:

1. Check in BEGIN0 of at.fort for
   1.1 the CUNIT, IUNIT, OUNIT
   1.2 in the OPEN-statement insert the full filename of the
       CHARS-file (first two lines above) on your system
2. Check in BEGIN1 the size of BETA.
3. When you run the FORTRAN compiler on at.fort you may have
   to increase the symbol table size by an option. For example
   under Berkely UNIX you say
   f77 -Nx2000 at.f
   This gives an increase of the default symbol table size by a factor
   of 10.  Also note the change of the extension from .fort to .f .
4. The new version does a much more improved error checking
   compared to the previous releases. The warnings of common inputs
   and outputs, and the warning on defined (i. e. assigned) local
   variables which are not used may be in most cases ignored, but
   sometimes they spot otherwise hard to detect errors.
5. Any questions and suggestions for improvement  to
