   ccsplit:        C-code-split
                   input (stdin): C code source file
                   output: one file for each algorithm in input named by
                           <algorithm name>.c 
                   bugs: Works only with C code files from the ALDES-C-
                         translator.
                         The existance of files is checked by opening 
                         them for read access. This fails if there are files
                         without read-permission in the current directory.
