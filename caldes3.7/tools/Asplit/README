                   input (stdin): ALDES-source file
                   output: one file for each algorithm in input named by
                           <algorithm name>.ald and
                           a file globals for all global external
                           comments and declarations
                   bugs: assumes that at least 17 blanks preceede each
                         algorithm name in the input file
