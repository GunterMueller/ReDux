This directory contains preassembled examples running programs from the
ReDuX demo directory.

The subdirectory PPP contains the exaples for the program ../demo/ppp.

For each example xxx in PPP there are two files:
    PPP/xxx.rdx	    containing a ReDuX specification and
    PPP/xxx.in      containing the user part of the dialog with the
                    ReDuX program PPP.
Then
    % cat PPP/xxx.in | ../demo/ppp PPP/xxx.rdx
produces the example. The result may be read from the log-file ppp.log.
