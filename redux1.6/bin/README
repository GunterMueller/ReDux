Description of the tools:

 ald
    See comments in the header of ald

 choosetype [<directory>]
    (see comments in choosetype)
    <directory> determines from which directory a *.typ file
    shall be selected interactively (default: typ).
    A file with name "_type_is_"<Typename>"_" in the working directory
    describes the contents of fort.4 an. (Such a file must perhaps be created
    with
        % echo > _type_is_
    ).
    
 rgrep <string for fgrep> [ac|ax|co|ic|tc|to|tp|<directory>]
    performs a recursive fgrep in all *.ald files of ReDuX/src,
    or if the according ReDuX-subsystem or directory

 toc <filename> ...
    <filename> is a name of an ALDES-source file, the suffix `.ald'
    may be omitted. The output will be directed to `stdout' and has the
    format:
       <Funct.-/Proc. head> : <filename>
    and is sorted alphabetically according the Funct.-/Proc. names.

Porting ReDuX:
  To port ReDuX possible some path names must be changed in some scripts.
  (In the distribution all path names are set as if ReDuX were located in
     /usr/local/redux
   and ALDES/SAC2 were located in
     /usr/local/caldes
  )

  ald: check $BE and $ALDES
  toc: check $RDX
