# dtcv:
# This file converts data types from old style to new style.
# Usage: dtcv <filename>
# Input (data type file) is read from file "filename".
# The converted data type is written to standard output.
# CAUTION: There are several limitations which data types can be converted!
#          These limitations comprise:
#            - no postfix operators with arity other than one
#            - all axioms must start on a separate line
#            - postfix operators at the end of an axiom must not
#              start on a new line
#            - there must not be an identifier named "&@&@&@"
