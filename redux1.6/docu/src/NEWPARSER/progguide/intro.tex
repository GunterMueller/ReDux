\section{Introduction}

This manual is intended to give the necessary information to understand
the internal structure of the parser and help programmers to extend
the parser to make it meet their needs.

It should be understood neither as an introduction to the specification
language of \redux\ data types nor as a stand-alone document. It will be
necessary to be familiar with the \ALDES\ programming language and with
some concepts of the \redux\ system. Therefore it may be useful
to see this manual as an extension to the \NPUG\ as well as
the \RUD.

The following sections explain the structure of the parser and the
new data structures used within the parser. Thereafter some information
on extension techniques will be given.
