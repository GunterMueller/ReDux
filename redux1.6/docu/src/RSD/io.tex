\section{The IO-Subsystem}

The {\it io}-subsystems contains the i/o-package IO which can be
\index{input-output}
linked to the programs instead of the SAC-2 package IO.
The \redux\  IO routines record all interactive i/o on
output stream~9  thus produce a protocol of a program session.
\index{protocol}
Under \ALDES\ 3.7 this is by default a file called 
$\langle$prog$\rangle${\tt .log} where $\langle$prog$\rangle$ is the name
of the main program.
With older versions of \ALDES\ this file is called {\tt file.9}.
