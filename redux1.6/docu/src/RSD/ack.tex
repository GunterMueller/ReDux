\section{Acknowledgments}
I am indebted to Prof.\ Wolfgang K\"{u}chlin and Prof.\ R\"{u}diger Loos.
The first one introduced me to programming term rewriting systems and 
and is actually the founder of the \redux-system since it is based on
his TC-system.
Prof.\ R\"{u}diger Loos provided for me the opportunity and the environment to 
develop this large piece of software.
Further  I want to thank Stefan Bachert, Hasko Eckhardt, Michael Joswig,
Werner Lauterbach, Carsten Sinz and J\"{u}rgen Wendel for contributing
to the system and Jochen Walter who in addition to the RD-subsystem
programmed many installation tools and
helped me with the documentation of the system.
