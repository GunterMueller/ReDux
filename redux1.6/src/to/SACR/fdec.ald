                    FDEC(T;T1,p,T2) 
[Operator decomposition. 
T is a QE formula or term in internal prefix 
representation. p is its top operator symbol. If p is unary T1=T2. 
If p is binary T1 is the first and T2 the second operand of T.] 
    safe FDEC. 
(1) [Split.] ADV(T;p,T1); if T1#() then {ADV(T1;T'1,T2); T1:=T'1; 
    if T2=() then T2:=T1 else T2:=FIRST(T2)} ||
