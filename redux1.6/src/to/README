Contents of directory .../ReDuX/src/to
======================================

This directory contains sources for some term ordering (to)
algorithms to be used with the Knuth-Bendix completion procedure.
The Knuth-Bendix ordering, the recursive path ordering 
(Kapur, Narendran, Sivakumar) as well as a package for computing
a polynomial interpretation of the terms are supplied.

This file: README.

Directory MAIN.
Contains algorithm to as an example main program
to illustrate the capability of the system.

Directory PI. [ Polynomial Interpretation ordering]
Contains the algorithms of the polynomial interpretation package
which implements the ordering proposed by Ben Cherifa and Lescanne.
See documentation of PI.

Directory PO. [ recursive Path Ordering ]
Contains algortihms toknsl.ald, toknsli.ald and tosqol.ald.

Directory SACR. [ ReDuX extensions of the SAC-2 system. ]

Directory YW. [polYnomial Write]
Contains some interface parts between the PI and the quantifier
elimination (QE) system. (obsolete if SACR is used)

File qewdummy.ald: dummy interface for linear quantifier elimination
File TOC: table of contents for all sources in this directory
File toint.ald: interactive routines
File tokb.ald: Knuth-Bendix ordering.
File torm.ald: routines to remove orderings
File tppo.ald: drive file for all orderings

Remark: .../ReDuX/lib contains the system libraries.
        There are (1) libto.a, which contains all PI and PO
        algorithms as well as toint, tokb, torm and tppo; (2) libyw.a, 
        which contains all YW algorithms and libsacr.a which contains
        all SACR algorithms.
        The librairy hierarchy is the following:
        libqew.a < libyw.a <  libto.a
        libsacr.a <  libto.a
