Installation Problems
=====================

Here we list a few problems that may occur during the installation.

* MAKEFILE (editing)

  When editing rinstall.w or Makefile make sure that your editor does
  not expand <TAB>s to <SPACE>s automatically.

  My emacs enters C-WEB-mode when editing rinstall.w which expands <TABS>.
  You may try 
   % emacs --no-site-file rinstall.w
  or
   % emacs --no-init-file rinstall.w
  if you too have that kind of problem.

* GNU-TOOLS (NAMES, PATHES, OPTIONS)

  There is no fixed standard as to the names and pathes of gnu-tools. 
  Mostly they have the standard-Unix names prefixed with a 'g'.
  We assume the default path /usr/local/bin.
  In particular in systems like Linux gnu-tools may be accessible under
  the unprefixed Unix-name. You must be aware of this if standard Unix tools
  and gnu tools require different options.

* SOLARIS (PATHES)

  In later Solaris versions some Unix tools are placed in /usr/ccs/bin.
  Make sure to include this path in your path-variable.

* LEX/FLEX

  The flex-library libfl.a is often hidden in the gnu or flex installation or
  library directory. You may need to use the option  "-L<dir-of-flexlib>"
  before the option "-lfl".

* CPP

  The gnu C-preprocessor (ccpp or cpp) is often hidden very deeply in the
  gcc library. E.g. on my Linux system it is under

  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.72/cpp

  You may  want to add a link from a bin-directory in your path variable
  to that file
