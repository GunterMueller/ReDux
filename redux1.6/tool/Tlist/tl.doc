tl is designed to extract addition information of .typ
files. However, it is easy to use it for other text files.

tl prints each line which contains a valid tl-keyword.
Text before the keyword will be omitted.
Actually the following list of keyword is supported

  AUTHOR BIBTEX DESCRIPTION KEYWORDS ORIGIN

Warning this word must be written in upper case letters.
This list can easily expanded. There is a special keyword STATUS.
Everything after this keyword will be print after the filename.


Usage
=====

USAGE tl [options] [dir]
  Options
  -a  AUTHOR
  -b  BIBTEX
  -d  DESCRIPTION [default]
  -k  KEYWORDS
  -o  ORIGIN
  -A  all above


Examples:
========

The source 'group.typ':

# Intro of comment symbol #
TYPE GRP1.
CONSTS 0-GRP1
# AUTHOR unknown
# STATUS completed
# DESCRIPTION1 very easy examples of nonabel group
# DESCRIPTION2 it is possible to use multiple line
# DESCRIPTION3 but since the output will be sorted line numberng should be used 
# BIBTEX THE ENTRY IS WRONG
# ORIGIN from heaven
VARS A,B,C-GRP1
OPS +(GRP1,GRP1)-GRP1.I(GRP1)-GRP1
AXIOMS
1) +(0,A)==A
2) +(I(A),A)==0
