   aglobs:         ALDES externally defined variables
                   SYNOPSIS
                        aglobs [text]
                   input (stdin): ALDES-source file
                   output (stdout): For each externally declared
                   variable, a line of the form 
                   safe|global <variable name>
                   or 
                   safe|global <variable name> text
                   if `text' is given is written to stdout. 
                   bugs:-  assumes that at least 15 blanks preceede each
                           algorithm name in the input file
                        -  assumes that there are no non-blank
                           characters between a end-of-algorithm sign (||)
                           and the end of a line.
                        -  indices of global array declarations are
                           not written to stdout.

   rglobs:         ALDES/ReDuX externally defined variables in directory
                   SYNOPSIS
                        rglobs [ac|ax|co|ic|tc|to|tp|<directory>]

                   output (stdout): All externally defined global variables, 
                                    together with the type `safe' or `global' 
                                    and the file they are declared in of the
                                    ALDES sources of the ReDuX system.
                                    If one of the options [ac|ax|co|ic|tc|to|tp]
                                    is used only the according ReDuX subsystem 
                                    is searched through, if <directory> is 
                                    provided as second argument then <directory>
                                    is scanned recursively for files which match
                                    *.ald.

                   A sorted list of all externally declared variables in the
                   ReDuX system can be ontained by

                               rglobs | sort +1

                   Bugs: rglobs does by default not search in include files.

Generation of aglobs:
First, the LEX-file must be compiled to the C-file lex.yy.c:
   lex aglobs.lex
Then the C-file must be compiled to the executable program aglobs:
   cc -o aglobs.<architecture> lex.yy.c -ll

Porting ReDuX:
   change variables RDXS and RDXB in rglobs
