8 Nov 1994 WSI Universitaet Tuebingen ReDuX Tools

This package provides two tools: blif2rdx and GetPathOrdering.

1) Blif2rdx:

Usage: blif2rdx -l ISIZE filename

Blif2rdx translates file filename using a subset of the Berkeley Logic
Interchange Format (BLIF) into an algebraic specification for the ReDuX term
rewriting system, which can be used to verify circuits. The output-file has
the prefix BLIF_ followed by the filename, without the extension .blif called
as model name, and the postfix .rdx.

Option:

    -l ISIZE

    The argument ISIZE expects an integer, that determines the width of the
    lines of the algebraic specification. ISIZE is preset to 80, which is the
    usual input width of ReDuX programs.

Restrictions:
    The supported subset of BLIF statements is:
        .model
                 with substatements .inputs .outputs .clock .end allowed. Only
                 one .model statement with one .clock substatement is
                 supported!
        .names
        .latch I O i
                 with i in {0,1}
        .latch I O i type control
                 with i in {0,1}, type in {fe,re} and control being a
                 clockname. All .latch statements must have the same type and
                 the same control parameters. If .clock is defined in .model
                 control must be this clock.

Output:
    BLIF_modelname.rdx
        The ReDuX file.
    BLIF_modelname.variables
        This file gives a reference of the hardware variables and there
        representation in ReDuX.

2) Blif2typ:

The same as Blif2rdx, but the output is suitable for the old
specification parser.


3) GetPathOrdering:

Usage: GetPathOrdering filename

GetPathOrdering produces a file that is used as input-file for ReDuX
and describes the path-ordering of the file filename, that is produced
by blif2rdx or a normalized derivative of it. Each Rule of the input
file filename must be on one line or each line-break but the last one
must ends with a comma.

Output:
    filename.PathOrdering

4) GetPathOrdering_old:

The same as GetPathOrdering, but the output is suitable for the old
specification parser.

For more information see blif2rdx(l), blif2typ(l), GetPathOrdering(l) and
GetPathOrdering_old(l).
